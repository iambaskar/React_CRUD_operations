## Axios

Axios is a simple promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js.

Operations you'll be performing with Axios and your API endpoint â€” retrieving, creating, updating, and deleting posts:

### Why you should use Axios as your client to make HTTP requests:

Working with JSON datas unlike Fetch API, you don't need to set your headers.
Axios does more with less code. 

Unlike the Fetch API, you only need one .then() callback to access your requested JSON data.

It has better error handling and it only throws 400 and 500 range errors.

It can be used on the server as well as the client.
